Verified automatic build on GitHub push

Task 4: GitHub Repo Setup (python-jenkins)
Created GitHub repository manually
Generated GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token)
Initialized local git repo and pushed code using PAT

Task 5: Jenkinsfile for Flask App
Wrote a Jenkinsfile with pipeline stages:
Clone
Build Docker image
Run container

Task 6: Jenkins Pipeline Job from GitHub

Used "Pipeline from SCM"
Connected to GitHub main branch
Triggered job and resolved branch errors

Task 7: Docker + Jenkins Pipeline Integration

Confirmed Docker installation on Jenkins server
Built and ran Flask app using Docker inside Jenkins pipeline

Task 8: Docker Installation for Jenkins
Installed Docker on EC2 Jenkins host
Added Jenkins user to Docker group
Restarted Jenkins to apply changes

Task 9: Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
Created Docker Hub account/repo
Added DockerHub credentials in Jenkins
Used docker login and docker push from Jenkinsfile

Task 10: Docker Compose Deployment with Nginx
Created a simple static website with index.html
Built Docker image using Dockerfile
Wrote docker-compose.yml to deploy container
Jenkins pipeline stages:
Clone from GitHub
Build Docker image

Push image to Docker Hub
Deploy using docker-compose
Accessed via http://<EC2-IP>:8080

Task 11: Jenkins CI/CD for Docker Compose App (Nginx Static Website)
We will:

Use Nginx as a simple web server
Create a static website (e.g., index.html)
Write a Dockerfile to package it
Use Docker Compose to run the container
Automate everything via a Jenkins pipeline

Task 12: CI/CD with Docker Compose for a 2-Tier Web App (Nginx + PHP or Node + MySQL)
This task will help you learn how to:

Use multiple containers (web + database)
Connect them using Docker Compose networks
Manage CI/CD using Jenkins Pipeline
Push images to Docker Hub
Automate everything via GitHub + Jenkins
App Architecture:

 Nginx (Frontend) + MySQL (Database) using Docker Compose (2-tier Architecture)
🔧 What is 2-tier architecture?
In a 2-tier app:
Tier 1: Frontend (Nginx) – Static web UI (HTML/JS/CSS)
Tier 2: Backend Database (MySQL) – Stores data like user info, products, etc.

TASK :13
 Jenkins + Docker Compose multi-container project 
creating a mini CI/CD project using Jenkins, Docker Compose, Flask, and MySQL.
It’s a simple web application that:
Uses Python (Flask) to display a web page.
Connects to a MySQL database to fetch data.
Is containerized using Docker.
Uses Docker Compose to manage both containers (Flask + MySQL) together.
Is automated by Jenkins — so whenever you push code to GitHub, Jenkins:
Clones the repo.
Builds Docker images.

Python (Flask) as the backend.
MySQL as the database.
Docker Compose to manage both containers.
Jenkins to automate the CI/CD pipeline.

Here’s the story of your app:
User hits the app in browser → Flask app responds.
Flask app talks to MySQL, gets some text like “Hello from MySQL!”.
Docker makes Flask and MySQL run as separate containers.
Docker Compose launches both together, makes sure Flask waits for MySQL.
Jenkins automates this whole setup each time code changes in GitHub.
